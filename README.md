Simple Blog Manager

This is an application that can be very useful for a blogger.
The blogger can add a new blog post including a title, the author and an image to go with it.
The blogger can see the blog posts that have been published as they are displayed on the side bar with their titles.
The blogger also has the option of deleting an individual blog post.
The blogger has the advantage of having his/her first blog post being displayed on page load.

This application runs on JSON server.
To run the application;-
First clone the repo and open the repo in VScode on your computer.
Then start the JSON server using "json-server --watch db.json" command on the terminal.
Finally run the index.html using live-server.
Enjoy!
